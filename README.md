# Connect Re-design Project

## Purpose of Project

The current Connect dashboard gave me eye cancer - so I decided to redesign it. 

This is by NO MEANS going to actually be functional - it's just for the aesthetics. I'm also by no means an experienced web dev - my redesign may still give you eye cancer, but it won't be as bad as the actual one.
